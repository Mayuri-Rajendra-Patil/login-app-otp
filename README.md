To build a login application with phone OTP verification and backend APIs, you will need to set up a backend server and integrate it with the Google Firebase API for sending OTPs. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to implement this:

Step 1: Set up a Backend Server
Choose a backend programming language/framework t Node.js . Set up a new project and install the necessary dependencies.

Step 2: Integrate Firebase Authentication
Sign up for a Google Firebase account and create a new project. Enable the Firebase Authentication service and configure it to use phone number authentication.

Step 3: Implement Phone OTP Verification
Use the Firebase Authentication SDK to generate and send OTPs to the user's phone number

Step 4: Store User Data in a Database
After successful OTP verification, you'll need to store the user's phone number and OTP in a database.

Frontend (React):

The frontend will be built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
The login page will collect the user's phone number and provide a button to initiate the OTP verification process.
Upon clicking the button, an API call will be made to the backend to send an OTP to the provided phone number.
After successful OTP verification, the user will be redirected to a dashboard or a designated authenticated area.
